This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue arises when attempting to use Tailwind directives within a component's template, but the directives aren't applied correctly. For example, using the `class` attribute with Tailwind classes may not produce the expected styles.

```jsx
//Buggy Component
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-red-500 p-4">
      <p>This text should be red and have padding.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
