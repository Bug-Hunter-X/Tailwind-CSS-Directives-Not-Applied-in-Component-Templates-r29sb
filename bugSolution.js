The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and integrated with your framework. In Next.js or Nuxt.js, this typically involves verifying the `tailwind.config.js` file and confirming that the framework's build process is correctly processing your components.  Here's an example of a corrected component:

```jsx
//Corrected Component
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-red-500 p-4">
      <p>This text should be red and have padding.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Important:**  This often requires checking the framework's documentation for proper Tailwind integration.  In many cases, the solution will involve restarting the development server after making any configuration changes to ensure that Tailwind's styles are recompiled.
