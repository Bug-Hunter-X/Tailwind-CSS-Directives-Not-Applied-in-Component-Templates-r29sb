# Tailwind CSS Directive Application Issue in Component Templates

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS within component-based frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js. The problem involves Tailwind directives failing to apply correctly within component templates, leading to unexpected styling results.

## Problem Description
When incorporating Tailwind classes into a component's JSX, the expected styles might not be rendered.  This often stems from configuration issues within the framework's build process or incorrect usage of Tailwind's directives.

## Solution
The solution usually involves ensuring that the Tailwind CSS build process correctly processes the component's template and integrates the necessary CSS.  This may include verifying the configuration of Tailwind within your framework, ensuring proper import statements, and confirming that the framework's build process compiles the necessary styles correctly. The provided solution file illustrates a correction to the component to address the style application.
